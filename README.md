# pythonFinancialTracker
private financial tracker to help me keep up with everything
also an excuse to make something in python. 
also an excuse to use pandas to read/write into an xlsx file.

currently, all my normal functions have been made. 
I plan to next:
- create a gui to create an application. showing all three debts, bills, and incomes. maybe in different tabs
- allow editing the text, so that i can make update/add/del buttons.
- attach functions to buttons
- detach my example fincancial xlsx file, allowing the app to create a blank and fill it up with user info
